These Terms of Use along with our Privacy Policy and Data Processing Addendum (the “DPA”) incorporated herein, constitute the agreement (the “Agreement”) established by and between LiveChat, Inc. with its principal office in Boston, Massachusetts, address: 101 Arch Street, 8th Floor, Boston MA 02110, United States of America (referred to as ”LiveChat”, ‘we" or “us” or ‘the Company") and any person or entity registering to or using the Services supplied by us (referred to as “Client” and “you”) collectively “parties”, individually “party”.

Accepting this Agreement is a condition of using the Services provided by LiveChat. ​​BY COMPLETING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS, ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT (I) YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND ACCEPTED THIS AGREEMENT, (II) YOU HEREBY REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO ENTER OR ACT ON BEHALF OF THE OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT, AND BIND TO THIS AGREEMENT AND (III) YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS FOR COMMERCIAL/BUSINESS PURPOSES ONLY. If you do not have the legal authority to enter this Agreement, do not understand this Agreement, or do not agree to the Agreement, please do not register to, or use the Services. Agree with us? Great, read on!

You and we agree and are bound by the following provisions:

This Agreement is effective between you and us on the day of your registration, access to or use of the Services (as further defined below) or by executing an applicable Order Form (the “Effective Date”).

Definitions
The following terms shall have the meaning specified below:

“Account”/“License” means the account created by the Client to Services.

“Agent” means a named user(s) in the Services who are permitted by the Client to use and operate the Services for or on behalf of the Client.

“Confidential Information” means all nonpublic information, whether written or oral, provided by the disclosing party to the receiving party and which (i) is known by the receiving party to be confidential; (ii) is marked as or stated to be confidential.

“Client Data” means data, information (including but not limited to Personal Data) and any material, content, phrases, entries uploaded to or created in the Services or transmitted through or stored in the Services (collectively “Input”) by the Client, its Agents or any End-User, or otherwise made available, by or for Client to or through the Services.

“End-Users” mean customers of the Client.

“Order Form” means any applicable ordering document between the parties that specifies mutually agreed upon rates for certain Services and other commercial terms. Each Order Form executed by the parties is governed by this Agreement and is subject thereto.

“Services” any services or applications provided by LiveChat to you (a) on a trial Services basis free of charge or (b) as Paid Services.

“Personal Data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person under the Client’s Account, who can be identified, directly or indirectly.

“Sites” means any domain or application operated by LiveChat from which the Services are available to Clients.

“Sub-Processor” means any person or entity (including any third party who renders services to the Company), authorized as another processor under the Agreement to have logical access to and process Personal Data in order to provide parts of the Services.

1. General
1.2. Client’s access to the Internet is not the subject of the Agreement and LiveChat does not guarantee the compatibility of offered Services with other providers’ software. The Client bears sole responsibility for the functionality of its Internet network, including the transmission paths and its own hardware and for the choice and consequences of using other software, including its applicability to the Client’s objectives.

1.3 Usage of the Services is subject to the then-current version of the Agreement posted on Sites. We reserve the right to update the provisions of this Terms of Use from time to time at our sole discretion, and the updated Terms of Use version supersedes all prior versions, as well as is effective and binding immediately after posting on Sites applicable for your Services. However, modifications affecting termination of our operations or terms of payment shall take place with prior explicit notice to you at least thirty (30) days prior to the change implementation and, if not clearly rejected within 7 (seven) days of the notification, are deemed accepted and binding. Therefore, we advise you to periodically review the latest currently effective Agreement. Your continued use of the Services on or after the date of the updated version of this Terms of Use is effective and constitutes your acceptance of such updated terms. If you do not agree to our updated Agreement you can delete your Account at any time.

2. Access and the use of the Services
2.1. When creating an Account and during the term of the Agreement, you must provide and keep the Account information true, accurate, current, and complete about yourself as requested to create and maintain the Account.

2.2. If you are the party that accepted the Agreement and you re-assign your Account to an authorized entity or person for administration purposes such Account re-assignment will not excuse your obligations under the Agreement and your use of the Services will continue to be subject to them.

2.3. Our Services can be accessed solely by logging in to the Services on a particular Site. Every Client is assigned credentials for the identification and authentication of Agents in the Services (except Services in which Agents are not required). Access to, and use of, the Services is restricted to the specified number of individual Agents permitted under the Client’s Account to the subscribed Services. The Client further agrees and acknowledges that the individual Agents’ login data for the Services shall only be used by one (1) designated individual Agent and may not (i) be passed on or used by others or several Agents at the same time, or (ii) shared or used by more than one Agent, but that Agent’s credentials may be reassigned to new individuals replacing former individuals who no longer require ongoing use of the Services. New and/or additional Agents must be notified in writing by you to LiveChat in advance so that individual login data can be provided to each Agent and, if necessary, the subscription fee re-calculated. You are solely responsible for the proper protection and storage of assigned password and log-in (credentials). The Client and its Agents are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of all of the Agent credential information for the Client’s Account.

2.4. The Client must be at least sixteen (16) years of age to be able to register and access an Account. LiveChat does not knowingly provide Services to any person under the age of sixteen (16). In the event that it comes to our knowledge that a person under the abovementioned age is accessing or using the Services, with no liability whatsoever towards such person, we will prohibit and block such Account without any prior notice and we will make all efforts to promptly delete any data with regard to such Account.

2.5. You are responsible for compliance with the provisions of the Agreement by you, Agents and End-Users and for any and all activities that occur under your Account. Without limiting the foregoing, you are solely responsible for ensuring that the use of the Services to store and transmit Client Data is compliant with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as any and all privacy policies, agreements or other obligations you may maintain or enter into with Agents or End-Users.

2.6. You are also solely responsible to obtain the authorizations, licenses and consents, if and as required by any applicable law, to make the Services available to End-Users. When you provide any Client Data to LiveChat, you (whether you are the Client or the administrator operating on behalf of the Client) represent and warrant that you have full authority to provide us with such Client Data.

2.7. The Client understands and has become familiar with the technical requirements necessary to access and use the Services and has no objections in respect thereof. The Client is aware of risks and threats connected with electronic data transmission.</mutableString>
